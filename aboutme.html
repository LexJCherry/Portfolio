		<p>Hello! My name is Lexxis Cherry (more commonly referred to as Lex).</p>
		<p>I have been coding now for almost two years and have loved every moment that I decided to make a career changes. At first I believed that I was going to be a veterinarian and attended Francis Marion University to do just that. I graduated Decemeber 2015 with my Bachelors of Science in Biology. The following year I started my journey to be a vet taking a job at Gentle Care Animal Hospital. It was not long after starting there I realized I loved animals but not the occupation.</p>
		<p>This meant going back to the drawing board and finding out what I loved all over again. At the same time the desire to build my own computer came over me as it had many times in my life. This time though I went for it. As I was research parts to us and skowering the internet for them I realized how much I loved technology. More important how much I have always loved technology. That is what inspired me to seek my Masters Degree in Information Technology and in Web Development more specifically.</p>
		<p>As I mentioned earlier I have loved learning the many languages I now use to make interactive responsive websites become fruition.</p>
